# STD_Deviation_exercise
# I use "escribe" to look at my parameters : "mean" , "std" itd.
# Import "seaborn" and use it to get "histplot" and look at my "Height" column
# Then i get the hight mean and save it into "mean" """mean = df.Height.mean()"""
# Also i get std_deviation and save it into "std_deviation" """std_deviation = df.Height.std()"""
